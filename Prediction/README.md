# UTR-LM: A Semi-supervised 5’ UTR Language Model for mRNA Translation and Expression Prediction

The untranslated region (UTR) of an RNA molecule plays a vital role in gene expression regulation. Specifically, the 5' UTR, located at the 5' end of an RNA molecule, is a critical determinant of the RNA’s translation efficiency. Language models have demonstrated their utility in predicting and optimizing the function of protein encoding sequences and genome sequences. In this study, we developed a semi-supervised language model for 5’ UTR, which is pre-trained on a combined library of random 5' UTRs and endogenous 5' UTRs from multiple species. We augmented the model with supervised information that can be computed given the sequence, including the secondary structure and minimum free energy, which improved the semantic representation.

# Prediction of MRL
On the App page, enter the fasta format of the 5'UTR sequence, and then click the "Predict" button. Sometimes after a short wait, the results will appear later on the page and you can download.
